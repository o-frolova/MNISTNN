# MNISTNN

<b>Task:</b> 
<p>The problem of classifying handwritten numbers on the mnist dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset.</p>

<b>Rules:</b>
- the solution should be in the form of a neural network written in numpy and trained using the gradient descent algorithm.
- the neural network should consist of two linear layers, relu and softmax activations, and mse loss.
- gradients must be calculated manually using a backpropagation algorithm using analytical derivative formulas.
- the solution is considered valid if it reaches an accuracy of more than 50%.
